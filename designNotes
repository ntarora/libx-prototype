Design notes:

Technologies:
	- Webpack 2.0 for building one file
	- es6 for syntax and classes
	- DOM tree walker - treeWalker
	- Promises for async


TODO:
	- Find a way to inject the JS code on they fly in the extension, look into tamper monkey. Debugging with source map is crucial
	- When a node is found yield the node and process
	- When finding nodes, return a node wrapped in promise through a generator
	- Then pass to textTransformer
	- Requirements to get inside the FF store


Overall Design Pattern:

	- Loader loads the modules, both 'apps' and 'utilities' (treeWalker, etc)
	- Loader sends regex Patterns to the walker
	- walker find nodes that match, pass them to the 'loader/app' for processing
	- the app then uses 'textTransformer' to manipulate the node
	-'App' then adds functionality to new nodes and passes it
	- the new nodes, are then passed into a another util to be placed in the DOM
